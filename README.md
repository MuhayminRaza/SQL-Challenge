# SQL-Challenge

This challenge asked us to finish some data engineering and modelling requirements. 
Data Engineering:
All required columns are defined for each table 
Columns are set to the correct data type 
Primary Keys set for each table 
Correctly references related tables 
Tables are correctly related using Foreign Keys 
Correctly uses NOT NULL condition on necessary columns

The following was written with the help of a TA in office hours:
SELECT employees.emp_no, employees.last_name, employees.first_name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
JOIN dept_emp ON dept_emp.emp_no = employees.emp_no
JOIN departments ON dept_emp.dept_no = departments.dept_no;

SELECT employees.emp_no, employees.last_name, employees.first_name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees AS e
JOIN dept_emp ON dept_emp.emp_no = employees.emp_no
JOIN departments ON dept_emp.dept_no = departments.dept_no WHERE dept_name = 'Sales' OR dept_name = 'Development';
